# Conclusion
Inhibiting telomere maintenance mechanisms does initially seem like a universal approach to fighting cancer, but it does have faults. Telomerase inhibition does seem to fight cancer, but I have shown cases where it causes Hematopoietic Stem Cell problems. Preliminary evidence suggests that turning off the alternative lengthening of telomeres mechanism may slow down the DNA Damage Response and, it is possible, that stem cells require intermittent ALT activity. Evern if you ignore the issues with a dual inhibition approach to telomerase and ALT, there is still the problem of the Ever Shorter Telomeres phenotype. The mild telomerase activity found in certain EST cells may be stopped by anti-telomerase approaches. However, the long telomere EST cells with a dysfunctional telomere trimming mechanism will need an additional approach. The dual telomere maintenance mechanism approach may need to include a method of specifically trimming telomere lengths in cancer cells without shortening stem cell telomeres. It's an extradinarily complicated challenge, but certainly one that should receive continued research support. Other anti-cancer approaches like immunotherapy may be a better therapeutic approach.
